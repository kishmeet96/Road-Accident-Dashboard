## Problem Statement :-
Clients wants to create a Road Accident Dashboard for year 2021 and 2022 so that they can have insight on the below requirements :-

## Requirements :-  
1. Primary KPI - Total Casualties taken place after the accident.
2. Primary KPI's - Total Casualties & Percentage of total with respect to accident severity and maximum Casualties by type of vehicle.
3. Secondary KPI's - Total Casualties with respect to vehicle type.
4. Monthly trent showing comparison of Casualties for Current year and Previous year
5. Maximum Casualties by Road Type 
6. Distribution of total casualties by Road Surface
7. Relation between casualties by Area/Location & by Day/Night

# Project Summary
The Road Accident Dashboard project for 2021 and 2022 is designed to offer a comprehensive analysis of road accident data. The dashboard aims to provide stakeholders with valuable insights into casualty trends, accident severity, vehicle types, and road conditions. By employing data cleaning, preprocessing, and advanced visualization techniques, the project helps in identifying patterns and making informed decisions to enhance road safety.

# Key Features & Skills Highlighted
### Total Casualties & Severity Analysis:
• Primary KPI: Total number of casualties resulting from accidents.
• Secondary KPIs: Breakdown of casualties by accident severity and vehicle type, including percentage calculations.

### Vehicle Type Impact:
• Casualty Distribution: Assess the total casualties and percentage distribution by different vehicle types.
• Maximum Casualties by Vehicle: Identify which vehicle types are associated with the highest number of casualties.

### Monthly Trends & Yearly Comparison:
• Monthly Casualty Trends: Visualize and compare monthly casualty data for 2021 and 2022 to detect trends and changes over time.

### Road Type & Surface Analysis:
• Casualties by Road Type: Determine which types of roads experience the most casualties.
• Casualties by Road Surface: Analyze how different road surface conditions affect casualty rates.

### Location & Temporal Analysis:
• Casualties by Area/Location: Explore how different geographic areas or locations contribute to overall casualty figures.
• Day/Night Casualty Comparison: Evaluate casualty rates during day versus night to identify any time-based patterns in accident frequency 


This project encompasses essential data cleaning, preprocessing, and visualization tasks to build an effective dashboard, offering stakeholders a detailed view of road accident metrics and trends.
